        <p class="text">
          The Emirate of Dubai (Arabic: إمارة دبيّ‎; pr. Imārat Dubayy) is one of the seven emirates of the United Arab
          Emirates.[5]

          The capital of the emirate is the eponymous city, Dubai. It is located in the Arabian Desert on the coast of
          the Persian Gulf. It is bordered to the south by the emirate of Abu Dhabi, to the northeast by the emirate of
          Sharjah, to the southeast by the country of Oman, to the west by the emirate of Ajman, and to the north by the
          emirate of Ras Al Khaimah. In December 1971, the emirates united to form the United Arab Emirates, thus ending
          their status as British Protectorates.

          The ruler of the emirate is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.[6]

          The emirate is made up of various other municipalities and villages. The inland exclave of Hatta is located
          about 134 km east of Dubai City. It is bordered by Oman to the east and south, the villages of Sayh Mudayrah
          and Masfout in Ajman to the west, and Ras Al Khaimah to the north.

            <strong>ABOUT PRIMME MINISTER OF DUBAI</strong>
            Al Maktoum has overseen the creation and growth of a number of businesses and economic assets of Dubai, with
            a number held by two companies under his ownership, Dubai World and Dubai Holding. According to the laws of
            Dubai, the ruling family owns all undeveloped land in Dubai, which has allowed the family to prosper from
            real estate development.[4] During Sheikh Mohammed's rule, Dubai has seen enormous population growth,
            causing a real estate boom in Dubai.[60] The boom was in part facilitated by Sheikh Mohammed's 2002 decree
            that foreigners would be allowed to purchase property in Dubai.[60]

            Al Maktoum established Dubai World by decree,[61] leading to the company's launch on 2 July 2006, as a
            holding company consolidating a number of assets including logistics company, DP World, property developer
            Nakheel Properties, and investment company Istithmar World. With more than 50,000 employees in over 100
            cities around the globe, the group has real estate, logistics and other business investments in the United
            States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. The company is owned by the government of Dubai.[61]

            Sheik Mohammed's personal corporate portfolio is the Dubai Holding Group, which is involved in a variety of
            investments.[61] Dubai Holding benefits from its association with the ruling family of Dubai, and is given
            free land by the Dubai government.[4]

            Al Maktoum was responsible for the launch of Emirates Airline.[62]
